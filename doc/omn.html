        TWe are approaching the era of the multinet. Instead of the one internet, we will have a multitude of parallel networks, customized by you to include anything and anyone you wish.
        The mechanisms to control the multinet are emerging in a demand-driven way, stemming from the needs of those who are developing and using the first experimental systems.
        Open Multinet forum has been created, among others by key stakeholders in the GENI and FIRE context, as a locus for community discussion and contributions to the evolution of these control mechanisms.
        The aim is to provide a common reference to serve as the basis for all those who wish to develop platforms and tools for the multinet - this includes the current federation approaches developed within GENI and FIRE.
        We welcome your participation. Please subscribe to the mailing list, dive into the documentation available in the git repository, and learn more about the multinet from the tutorials that are posted here.

        status.-->

      <h1>Concepts</h1>
      <section>
      <h2>Attribute</h2>
      <p>
        Describes the attributes of an omn:Group, omn:Resource, omn:Service or omn:Component in more detail.
        Examples: Monitoring information, Color attributes, Reservation information, QoS, SLAs, Location, Configuration, etc.
      </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h2>Component</h2>
      <p>
        An Entity that is part of an omn:Resource or omn:Service. It does not need to be an omn:Resource or an omn:Service itself.
        Examples: CPU, Sensor, Core, Port, Image.
      </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h2>Dependency</h2>
      <p>
        Helps to defines a directional relationship between omn:Resource, omn:Group, omn:Component or omn:Service. It makes it possible to annotate the dependencies with additional properties.
        Examples: application coloring (in GENI context), orchestration needs dependencies.
      </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h2>Environment</h2>
      <p>
        The operating conditions under which a omn:Resource, omn:Group, omn:Service is operating.
        Examples: interference, concurrent virtual machines, concurrent traffic, temperature, heat, etc.
      </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h2>Group</h2>
      <p>
        A collection of omn:Resource, omn:Service or omn:Group.
        Examples: Bi-directional Link, etc.
      </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h2>Topology</h2>
      <p>
        A collection of omn:Resource, omn:Service or omn:Group
        Examples: Infrastructure, Reservation, Slice, etc.
      </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h2>Layer</h2>
      <p>
        Describes a place within a hierarchy a specific omn:Group, omn:Resource, omn:Service or omn:Component can adapt to.
        Examples: In networking, an end-to-end connectivity has to be on the same layer (path finding). For resources, it can describe the capability to adapt to a virtualized version.
      </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h2>Resource</h2>
      <p>
        An Entity that can be provisioned/controlled/measured by APIs.
        Examples: Node, Link, People, etc.
      </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h2>Service</h2>
      <p>
        An Entity that has an API/capability to use it, it may depend on an omn:Resource.
        Examples: Aggregate Manager, Portal, Measurement Service, Hadoop, Broker, etc.
      </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h2>Reservation</h2>
      <p>
        A specification of a guarantee.
        Examples: (Earliest) Start and (latest) end time, data volume, etc.
      </p>
      </section>
    </section>
